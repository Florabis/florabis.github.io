## Royal Edicts Documentation Act
Primary Sponsor: @borito (Councilor of Agriculture and Resources)

Summary:
With our growing number of laws, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to know all (active) rules. Therefore, we propose creating a website to document all passed laws and directives. This channel will serve as the primary source of truth for laws in the state of Florabis. It can be seen as a cleaned-up version of `bills-and-proposals`.

Provisions:
1. Create a florabis github organization for all florabis related software
2. Create a repo containing the vite press website
3. Add people with write permission to the organization (cesar, era, nico, maya)
4. Import all the active laws to the repo
5. setup github pages so it actually hosts it

Implementation:
@borito for the creation of the organization and website
The primary sponsor of the passed bill, Councilor of Justice & Law, the Alcaldesa Mayor, and the Soberante for maintaining the website.
