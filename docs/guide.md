    - Command to return to Florabis:
        *  /dest imperial florabis

## Snitches & Pearling {#snitches-&-pearling}

**Do not commit crimes\!** Snitches log player activity in-game and in-discord, including breaking blocks or opening chests. To set up a snitch:

* Place down a juke block (logs) or note block (no logs)
* Reinforce juke block or note block using /ctr
* Check jukebox logs using /ja

If caught doing crimes, players will pearl you. This means that:

* A player kills you with an ender pearl in the hot bar.
* You are sent to the nether and cannot escape through any portal
* You can only be freed if your pearl is freed or runs out of fuel (essence).

## Ores and Ore Veins {#ores-and-ore-veins}

        * Example: 16 diamond ores to 60 diamonds
        * Example: 64 raw iron to 96 iron ingots
    - Ore exchanges can exchange ores for more ingots, but slightly worse than directly using factories.
        * Example: 16 diamond ores to 59 diamonds,
        * Example: 5 raw iron to 8 iron ingots
* Ores and ore veins spawn randomly as you dig.
    - A notification in chat will appear if you hit an ore vein.
    - Diamonds only spawn in diamond ore veins.
    - If you hit a diamond ore vein, **ONLY USE NETHRITE PICKS**
        * Netherite picks spawn up to 4 times more diamond ores.
* Additional tips
    - Mine at Y level \-35 for diamonds
    - Mine at Y level 15 for iron
    - Do not mine at bedrock

        * Do /config
        * Click the cauldron
        * Click the diamond ore
    - Setup chests to store extra blocks
        * Do not burn any blocks
* Digging out the vein **ONLY USE NETHRITE PICKS**
    - Dig out 5 blocks from the ore in each direction (X, Y, Z)
    - If you do not hit any ores, then dig 11 blocks in each direction.
    - Do not place blocks
* Collecting Diamond Ores
    - Only use silktouch
    - Collect and smelt ores at the end
    - 16 diamond ores can be melted into 60 diamonds

## Factories {#factories}

How to check what factories you can make:  
/fm

How to check if an item can be made or used in factories:  
/item name  
/item sand

List of all factories:
