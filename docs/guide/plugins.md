## Snitches & Pearling {#snitches-&-pearling}

**Do not commit crimes\!** Snitches log player activity in-game and in-discord, including breaking blocks or opening chests. To set up a snitch:

* Place down a juke block (logs) or note block (no logs)
* Reinforce juke block or note block using /ctr
* Check jukebox logs using /ja

If caught doing crimes, players will pearl you. This means that:

## Ores and Ore Veins {#ores-and-ore-veins}

        * Example: 16 diamond ores to 60 diamonds
        * Example: 64 raw iron to 96 iron ingots
    - Ore exchanges can exchange ores for more ingots, but slightly worse than directly using factories.
        * Example: 16 diamond ores to 59 diamonds,
        * Example: 5 raw iron to 8 iron ingots
* Ores and ore veins spawn randomly as you dig.
    - A notification in chat will appear if you hit an ore vein.
    - Diamonds only spawn in diamond ore veins.
    - If you hit a diamond ore vein, **ONLY USE NETHRITE PICKS**
        * Netherite picks spawn up to 4 times more diamond ores.
* Additional tips
    - Mine at Y level \-35 for diamonds

    - Do not mine at bedrock
